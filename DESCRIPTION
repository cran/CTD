Description: A method for pattern discovery in weighted graphs as outlined in Thistlethwaite et al. (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008550>. Two use cases are achieved: 1) Given a weighted graph and a subset of its nodes, do the nodes show significant connectedness? 2) Given a weighted graph and two subsets of its nodes, are the subsets close neighbors or distant?
